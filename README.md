## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

This is a **monorepo** with three main folders:

- **`/backend`** - Express.js API server handling database operations, authentication, payments, shipping, and AI requests
- **`/frontend`** - React storefront and admin dashboard where users shop, admins manage everything, and AI features live
- **`/shared`** - TypeScript types and utilities used by both frontend and backend

### How It Works

**For Customers:**

- Browse products on the storefront (`/frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx`)
- Chat with the AI assistant to learn more about each product
- Add items to cart, checkout with Stripe payments
- Create accounts and view order history

**For Admins:**

- Access admin dashboard at `/admin` route
- Manage products, orders, users, and site settings
- Generate AI-powered product descriptions automatically
- All admin functionality is in `/frontend/src/features/admin-dash/`

**For Developers:**

- Backend API routes are in `/backend/src/routes/`
- Frontend components are organized by feature in `/frontend/src/features/`
- Database schema is in `/backend/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Shared types ensure frontend and backend stay in sync
